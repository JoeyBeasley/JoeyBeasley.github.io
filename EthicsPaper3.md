Copyrights and Wrongs
====

  Copyright is an important aspect that applies to a lot of things, films, music, art, and even programming. While everybody is free to make their own content and share them with everybody, taking somebody else’s work and claiming it to be your own is illegal and highly unethical. This can also include stealing somebody else's code and using it for your desires against their agreement. Original, self created code is something that a programmer has the exclusive rights to, and anybody who does not comply is committing piracy. Because of all this, it is important for programmers to know all of their rights and responsibilities in this field.
	
 When you create code, you are the rightful owner responsible for it. You also need to follow a few simple principles such as making sure your intentions with the code are perfectly legal and aren’t intended to harm others. Software is also protected as a “literary work”, (mewburn) and copying from it without permission is considered infringement. The U.S. Copyright Office protects media such as applications and online content, with infringement being considered an act of theft. Plagiarism is an unlawful act that can happen in many different forms, including code, with the consequences being very severe.

 If you want to protect your code, you need a good license agreement, a long document stating you have rights to your code. One agreement I believe to be fair is from LeapLaw. LeapLaw is a long but very detailed agreement that provides specific information on exclusivity, derivative products, fees, warranties, and notices. The document itself is free and due to all the details, is very reliable in protecting your data and making sure the one agreeing to use it does not break any rules.
	
  As a programmer, you are responsible for respecting your and others’ copyright and personal data. The ACM Code of Ethics was created in order to “serve as a basis for ethical decision-making” (ACM) and lists principles such as contributing to the well being of society, avoiding harm caused by theft or dishonesty, and respecting privacy. The IEEE Code of Ethics is comparatively much shorter, but focuses more on regulating public behavior and “To treat all persons fairly and with respect” (IEEE). Going by these laws, one must not only be very honest and responsible when using code from another source, but also must treat all users with respect and use all code and programs responsibly. If not, they are breaking digital etiquette and the law.
	
 In the world of programming, we must follow a strict but important code of conduct, keep our own code protected, and avoid getting ourselves or others into legal trouble. We must also take responsibility for our own code and programs. We also must abide by and respect copyrights that belong to us and to others. Using license agreements help protect our own data and make sure anybody we are sharing it with is using it responsibly. If we stick by these rules, we create a net flow that is much more peaceful and productive.
