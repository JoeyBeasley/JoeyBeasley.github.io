## Project description

My team and I compiled a two player chess game through Java that runs in NetBeans. The game displays a Battleship-styled grid with letters representing the pieces (K for King, Q for Queen) and asks each player what space they want to move and what space they want to move the piece there to. It will ask if it the other player is in checkmate before it is the other player's turn.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

Open the folder in NetBeans. With the ChessMain file selected, click the green play button. The chessboard will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the space you want to move (ie, E2).



If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Make run would run the code. Make example-test runs the example test file. Make simple-test runs the simple test file from src.
